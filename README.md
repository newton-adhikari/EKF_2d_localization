# EKF Localization IN 2D

A Python project demonstrating robot localization using the **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**. This project models a differential drive robot navigating in a 2D plane, estimating its position and orientation based on noisy motion and sensor measurements relative to a fixed landmark.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Differential drive robot motion model with control inputs for velocity and angular rate
- Range and bearing measurement model to a known landmark
- Analytical Jacobians for motion and measurement models
- Full EKF cycle: prediction (motion update) and correction (measurement update)
- Uncertainty propagation via covariance matrices
- Limited 2D visualization of Robot trajectory and Pose:

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- **State Vector**: \(\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ \theta \end{bmatrix}\) â€” robotâ€™s 2D position and heading angle  
- **Control Inputs**: \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ \omega \end{bmatrix}\) â€” linear and angular velocities  
- **Measurement Model**: noisy range and bearing to a static landmark  
- **Jacobians**: matrices \(F\) and \(H\) for linearizing nonlinear motion and measurement models  
- **Covariance Matrix**: uncertainty representation updated at each step  
- **Kalman Gain**: weights prediction and measurement to produce optimal estimate  
- **Uncertainty Ellipse**: graphical depiction of pose covariance

## ðŸ“Š Visualization

The simulation uses `matplotlib` to display:

- Current robot pose as an arrow indicating orientation  
- Covariance ellipse around the robotâ€™s position to visualize uncertainty  
- Landmark position as a fixed point  
- Lines from robot to landmark representing measurements  
- Full trajectory history of the robotâ€™s estimated positions

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. **Initialization**  
   Set initial robot state, covariance matrix, landmark coordinates, and noise parameters.

2. **Prediction (Motion Update)**  
   Use the control inputs and the motion model to predict the new robot state and propagate uncertainty.

3. **Measurement Simulation**  
   Generate noisy range and bearing measurements to the landmark based on the predicted state.

4. **Correction (Measurement Update)**  
   Compute the Kalman Gain and update the robotâ€™s state and covariance with measurement information.

5. **Visualization Update**  
   Plot the updated state, covariance ellipse, and trajectory in real time.
